    <p>This webpage is going to be my journey and checklist of proccesses and practices I want to use for my growth.</p>
    <p> In this page I will go over why I wanted to start animation and some of my inspirations.</p>


</section>


<Section class="why" aria-label="Why I started section">

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>It feels like animation finds its way into everyone's life from a young age. For me, it was all about Disney's 2D character animations and the captivating world of Japanese anime. Both styles are incredibly expressive, with emotions and movements that effortlessly capture the imagination and leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches. </p>

            <h3>Evangelion</h3>
            <p>One of the first animations I've ever encountered was the anime called "Neon Genesis Evangelion"</p>
            <p>My all-time favorite show and what I reference numerous times in games, profiles, and etc.</p>

            <h3>Mike Inel</h3>
            <p>My animation journey had its ignition point with Mike Inel on YouTube. It all started with his video, "Missing Halloween", which captivated me instantly. As I delved deeper, watching gems like "What if 'The Amazing World of Gumball' was an anime" and "What if 'Gravity Falls' was an anime", I was completely hooked. Those shorts were pure magic, and peering into their creation process filled me with joy and wonder.</p>
            <p>Here's his YouTube page, and a process/workflow video I frequently watch. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mikeinel/videos" aria-label="Hyperlink to Mike Inel's Youtube Channel" class="btn">Mike Inel's Page</a> </p>

            <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2</h3>
            <p>Honestly, this one is pretty recent, but it was the deciding factor in my pursuit of animation. 'Jujutsu Kaisen' or JJK was animated by the studio MAPPA. Despite the controversies surrounding its workload on the employees and the frequent changes in animation styles between episodes, I found the second season to be incredibly expressive and creatively exciting. Every moment was visually stunning, and I cherished each second of it.</p>
            <p>Here is a clip from one of the fights in JJK. It was the Blueray edition and uploaded on to YouTube.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The first series I ever watched from Ufotable was Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works. Their animations were absolutely phenomenal, particularly with their lightning-fast action scenes that were so easy to follow. After that, I couldn't resist delving into their other projects, and they didn't disappoint! But when they animated DemonSlayer, it instantly became one of my all-time favorites.</p>

                    <p>I've been eyeing this utterly fantastic mobile animation application for ages now. When it finally dropped, it sparked this massive wave of animation all over social media. I binged through a bunch of them, and let me tell you, they seriously inspired me to dig deeper into the whole animation process. Some of those animations were just mind-blowing, leaving me with a big 'wow'.</p>

                    <p>An animation style that rids itself of clear cut lines and details. It focuses more on fluidity and a flat 2d way to shading. This is where the famous 'never pause an animation' comes from. I believe anime Naruto uses this animation school in some of its fights.</p>

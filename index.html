    <p>This webpage is going to be my journey and checklist of proccesses and practices I want to use for my growth.</p>
    <p> In this page I will go over why I wanted to start animation and some of my inspirations.</p>


</section>


<Section class="why" aria-label="Why I started section">

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>I feel like everyone from a young age was exposed to some form of animation. For me, it was 2d character animation in the form of Disney as well as Japanese animation. All extremely expressive in emotion and motions that actively and exquisitely captures the heart and eyes of onlookers. </p>

    <h2>Some of My Inspirations</h2>

            <h3>Evangelion</h3>
            <p>One of the first animations I've ever encountered was the anime called "Neon Genesis Evangelion"</p>
            <p>My all-time favorite show and what I reference numerous times in games, profiles, and etc.</p>

            <h3>Mike Inel</h3>
            <p>My NUMBER 1 inspiration for starting animation began with Mike Inel on YouTube. I first stumbled upon his video, "Missing Halloween", then proceeded to watch the rest. The videos that really got me into animation were "Missing Halloween", "What if "The Amazing World of Gumball" was an anime", and "What if "Gravity Falls" was an anime". All of which are fantastic shorts and it was a joy and wonder to see the processes behind them.</p>
            <p>Here's his YouTube page, and a process/workflow video I frequently watch. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mikeinel/videos" aria-label="Hyperlink to Mike Inel's Youtube Channel" class="btn">Mike Inel's Page</a> </p>

            <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2</h3>
            <p>Honestly, this one is pretty recent, but it was the deciding factor in my pursuit of animation. 'Jujutsu Kaisen' or JJK was animated by the studio MAPPA. Despite the controversies surrounding its workload on the employees and the frequent changes in animation styles between episodes, I found the second season to be incredibly expressive and creatively exciting. Every moment was visually stunning, and I cherished each second of it.</p>
            <p>Here is a clip from one of the fights in JJK. It was the Blueray edition and uploaded on to YouTube.</p>

                    <p>The first series I've ever watched made by Ufotable was Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works. Phenomal animations with their fast paced and easy to read action scenes. Ever since watching that show I started looking into their other works and continued to do so until they animated DemonSlayer. Probably one of my favourite animations out there.</p>

                    <p>An utterly fantastic animation application for mobile that I have been wanting to try out for ages now. When it first came out, there was a HUGE surge in animation on social media and having watched a good portion of them, I was heavily inspired to look more into the animation workflow as well as processes. There were some fantastic animations made that really made me think "wow"</p>

                    <p>An animation style that rids itself of clear cut lines and details. It focuses more on fluidity and a flat 2d way to shading. This is where the famous 'never pause an animation' comes from. I believe anime Naruto uses this animation school in some of its fights.</p>
